    "Definition": "In this task, you are given a word, followed by a sentence. You should respond with a valid sentence which contains the word with the same meaning as in the given sentence. For example, if the given sentence refers to a 'fly' (the insect), you should not respond with a sentence which uses 'fly' (the verb). You may use the word in a different tense than is given. For example, you may use the word 'ended' in a sentence where the given word is 'end'.",
